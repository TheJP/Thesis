\section{Speed Measurements} \label{sec:measurements-speed}
This section shows the result of two speed comparisons and discusses the conclusions that were drawn. The shown measurements are always the mean of at least ten results. A table showing all exact results was added to the appendix.

The measuring was done by inserting profiling code. The .Net Framework provides helpful tools for such measurements, so the actually added code was only a few lines long.

\subsection{K-Means}
The first figure \ref{fig:kmeans_speed} shows speed measurements of the K-Means algorithm applied to Weimar in different settings.

The used parameters were for all four measurements the following (Those parameters can be manually set as shown in the appendix in figure \ref{fig:applied_k-means_GUI}.):

\begin{itemize}
    \item No live visualisation
    \item Number of tries: 10
    \item Iterations per try: 10
    \item Minimal cluster count: 5
    \item Maximal cluster count: 15
\end{itemize}

The different bars of the diagram have the following meaning:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Original:} Initial implementation of K-Means without performance or other improvements.
    \item \textbf{Original \& Shortest Path:} Implementation of K-Means without performance improvement but additional run of \acrshort{APSP} (Dijkstra, not parallel) to improve the result quality.
    \item \textbf{Parallel:} Implementation of K-Means which runs multiple tries parallelised.
    \item \textbf{Parallel \& Shortest Path:} Implementation of K-Means which runs multiple tries parallelised and additionally runs \acrshort{APSP} (Dijkstra, parallel).
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

As it is clearly visible, parallelisation almost doubles the performance of K-Means. Adding an \acrshort{APSP} does only inflict a minor slowdown in both the parallel and the original implementation.

\subsection{Hierarchical Clustering}

\section{Cluster Analysis}
\label{sec:measurements-cluster-analysis}
In this section the provided measurement methods \ref{sec:clusterRating} are used to compare the measured results between the different districts/areas. The following images were generated with the cluster algorithm FastUPGMA \ref{sec:UPGMAandWPGMA} on Weimar with \textit{Modified Output} and \textit{Number of Clusters} count 16.

A example for every district from the section \ref{sec:concept_cluster_analysis} was found. Three different colours can be observed. Red labelled edges are within the cluster. Grey edges are transitions between different clusters and black edges are outside of the cluster.

As expected in section \ref{sec:historyDistinct} the historic subgraph (figure \ref{fig:result_historic_district}) had a high block count on a small area. The street count, the vertex connections mean and the density are high. All results for this cluster can be viewed in table \ref{tab:measured_cluster_ratings} cluster number c1.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \end{mdframed}
    \caption{Historic District Subgraph}
    \label{fig:result_historic_district}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier

Like anticipated in section \ref{sec:businessDistinct} the business district (figure \ref{fig:result_business_district}) had the highest relative block area (A/Ac) and a very high integration value. The mean connection count and the density are much higher compared with the historic district. This insights can be observed in table \ref{tab:measured_cluster_ratings} cluster number C2.

    \begin{mdframed}[style=mdthight, userdefinedwidth=0.4\textwidth, align=center]

    \end{mdframed}
    \caption{Business District Subgraph}
    \label{fig:result_business_district}
\end{figure}

A detected outskirts subgraph can be viewed in figure \ref{fig:result_outskirts_district}. The measured results can be found in table \ref{tab:measured_cluster_ratings} cluster number C3. They show as expected a high street length variance and median. The density is very high because of a low street count on a big area.

\subsection{Measured Data}
\label{sec:ClusterAnalysisMeasurements}
The following table \ref{tab:cluterAnalysisDescription} contains the parameters with additional descriptions. Of every parameter the minimal (min), maximal (max), mean (average) and the median value can be calculated. Because the min, max values don't have any relevance they were skipped in this table. All measurements can be observed in the appendix in \ref{sec:measurements_full_table}.
