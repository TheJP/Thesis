\begin{abstract}
	We present a programming technique for implementing
	The appeal in our approach is that it relies on existing mechanisms,
	specifically templates, and does not require any
	modification to the existing language.
	The practical value of the technique was demonstrated
	in its successful incorporation in a large software body.
	We identify the ingredients of a programming language
	required for applying the technique, and discuss
	extensions to other languages.
