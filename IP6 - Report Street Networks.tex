\chapter{Introduction}
In this thesis the initial task was to learn how street network and buildings can be described as grammar for later analysis and regeneration. There exist many different approaches like Shape Grammar \ref{sec:shape_grammar} (building faces generation), L-Systems \ref{sec:L-Systems} (plants growing), Space Syntax \ref{sec:space_syntax} and many others. 

The \textit{Chair of Information Architecture} provided a street generation and analysing tool named CPlan \ref{CPlan}. To become acquainted with the application and to allow using the existing genetic algorithms a tree generating algorithm was developed by us. 

Selecting interesting areas from different cities and recombining then into a new one would allow a fast creation of new cities. To reach this aim many steps are needed. First of all the cities must be separate into reasonable parts based on vertex position or edge length. The approach of this thesis is to use clustering algorithms from the area of machine learning. Then the different area should be valued to select useful areas.

In this document flat (K-Means ) and hierarchical (WPGMA, UPGMA) clustering algorithms where compared and extended to correct 
For speed and result reasons 





The cluster can be evaluated by measurement methods provided by the architecture department of the ETH-Zurich.
