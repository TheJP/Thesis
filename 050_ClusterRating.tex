\section{Cluster Rating}
\label{clusterRating}
To evaluate the generated clusters different measurement methods are necessary. Jun. Prof. Dr.  Reinhard KÃ¶nig from the ETH Zurich provided the following parameters.
\newline
\begin{itemize}
    \item Geometry based measurements:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Area based on the convex hull of the cluster area
        \item Total length of the streets
        \item Ratio between the area and total length
        \item Distribution variance of the street length
        \item Distribution variance of the street angles
        \item Ratio between street block size and surrounding circle area (minima, maxima, mean)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Centrality-based measurements normalized by the street count (minima, maxima, mean):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In-Centrality (Integration)
        \item In-Betweenness-Centrality (Choice)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The centrality based ratings and the block area calculation where pre implemented in CPlan \ref{CPlan}. Additional a GUI to compared and stored the results as JSON-File for each generated cluster has been added.

Some initial measurements and comparisons are made in the cluster analysis chapter \ref{sec:ClusterAnalysisMeasurements}.
