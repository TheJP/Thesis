\chapter{Evaluation}
Many additional functionality were added into the application CPlan. A tree from an existing graph can be created. The recreated graphs are nearly equal to the initial graph. Unfortunately no further development and testing could be made because trees were not the main goal of this thesis.

Cities can now be partitioned by many implemented clustering algorithms created for this thesis. The extracted subgraphs were nearly equal to the described districts in the concept. Measurements can be made on the extracted subgraphs. Unfortunately it was not possible to add additional features to separate the created cities based on more analysis data.

Exports of the created cities and measured data can be made to recreate new cities based on the subgraphs. Future development to create new cities based on the extracted clusters would be very attractive but could not be implemented because it would exceed the time frame of this thesis.
