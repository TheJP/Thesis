\chapter{Evaluation}
Many additional functionalities were added into \acrshort{acr:CPlan}. A tree from an existing graph can be created. The recreated graphs are nearly equal to the initial graph. Unfortunately no further development and testing could be made because this conversion was not the main goal of the thesis.

Cities can now be partitioned by many clustering algorithms implemented for this thesis. The extracted clusters had the properties, that were expected for districts in the concept. Measurements can be made on the extracted clusters.

Exports of the created cities and measured data can be made to recreate new cities based on the clusters. Future development to create new cities based on the extracted clusters would be very attractive but could not be implemented because it would exceed the time frame and scope of this thesis.
