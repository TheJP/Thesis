\chapter{Problem}
Selecting interesting areas from different cities and recombining them into a new one would allow a fast creation of new cities. To reach this aim many steps are necessary. First of all the cities must be separated into reasonable parts based on vertex position or edge length. The approach of this thesis is to use clustering algorithms from the field of machine learning. Useful cluster areas can then be selected by comparing different measured values like the variance of the street length or the median block length.
