\chapter{Problem}
With the application CPlan \ref{CPlan} cities can be imported and block areas created. Many growing algorithms with random parameter exist and are fully working. The apply modification on the created cities a tree should be created from the existing street network. This would allow genetic modifications on existing networks.

Random parameters to generate new cities are a good approach but it is not possible to use existing map data. To work with predefined subnetworks of a city map these parts have to be separated based on the given data.

The extracted parts should then be measured for their usefulness to reuse and recombine them at a new position in a new generated city.
