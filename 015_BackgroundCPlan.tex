\section{CPlan}
\label{CPlan}
CPlan is a tool written by the Department of Architecture of the ETH-Zurich. The main idea is to build a library which allows analysing, growing and extending of street networks. Additionally a viewer tools is provided witch implement the library to visualize the results. \citep{cPlan:2015}

\subsection{Growing}
Algorithms allow to grow street networks randomly and modified them with genetic algorithms.

\subsection{Current Improvements}
Currently many projects are in progress to extend the generated street networks with automatic block creation and extraction from OpenStreetMap.
