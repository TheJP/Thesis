\section{CPlan}
\label{CPlan}
\gls{acr:CPlan} are tools, which were created as a collaboration of several research groups. The main idea was to build an open source library which allows analysing, growing and extending of cities. Additionally, a geometry viewer was provided and implemented in the library to visualise the results as 2D and 3D models \citep{cPlan:2015}.

\subsection{Growing}
Algorithms allow to grow street networks randomly and modify them with genetic algorithms.

\subsection{Current Improvements}
Currently many projects are in progress to extend the generated street networks with automatic block / building creation and extraction from \gls{OSM}.

During this thesis the functionality of \gls{acr:CPlan} was extended by the algorithms described in this document.
