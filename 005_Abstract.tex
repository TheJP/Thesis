    In this document different grammars to describe buildings, streets or plants were discussed and checked for their usefulness.
    
    Then centroid-based (K-Means) and hierarchical (WPGMA, UPGMA) clustering algorithms were compared and extended to correct wrong assignments and to reduce the memory footprint. 

    Finally the created clusters were measured and compared.
