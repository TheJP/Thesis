    In this document centroid-based \ref{sec:K-Means} (K-Means) and hierarchical \ref{sec:hierarchicalClustering} (WPGMA, UPGMA) clustering algorithms were compared \ref{sec:measurements-speed} and extended to correct wrong assignments \ref{sec:K-Means_shortest_path} and to reduce the memory footprint \ref{sec:memory_usage}. 

    The implemented clusters where then measured \ref{sec:measurements} based on the suggestions \ref{sec:clusterRating} provided by the ETH-Zurich and compared \ref{sec:measurements-cluster-analysis}. Additionally the results can now be exported into a JSON-File for further use.
